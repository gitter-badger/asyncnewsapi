# asyncnewsapi

An asyncio Python library to perform request against [News API](https://newsapi.org). It provides direct access to the endpoints defined in the [documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints).

It's loosely based on [newsapi-python](https://github.com/mattlisiv/newsapi-python), a requests based library by Matt Lisivick.
